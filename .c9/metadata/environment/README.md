Pro Cycling Trumps Game","","## Introduction","This application is a simple, interactive and fun game to test someone's knowledge. The game basically consists of a image and a textfield. When typing in the right answer in the textfield, the image flips and the right answer is shown. There is also a possibility to ask for a hint.","","This specific version of the game uses images from Pro Cycling Trumps (PCT). PCT is a British concept which basically contains of simple but fitting drawings of pro cyclists on playing cards. Naturally other images can be used as well. ","The design of the game is also very suited for learning a language; the player than has to type in the name of the object the image shows in the language he or she is learning.","","- [View the game here](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project)","- [View the Github Repository here](https://peterlenting.github.io/second-milestone-project/index.html)","","## Contents table","1.

[Disclaimer](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project#disclaimer)","","## UX","","### What is it?","A clean, fast and well-arranged application, which gives the visitor a fun experience, an opportunity to upgrade their knowledge and to be interactive with, in this case, PCT. ","A single page application with a mobile first design. The game should be really simple and easy to play, but also fun and interactive.","","### Who is the target audience? ","Anybody who likes to test their knowledge on any subject in a fun way is a member of the target audience.","In this specific case the target audience is the international pro cycling fan. People who know a little more about the pro peloton and like to test their knowledge. Maybe they are costumers of Pro Cycling Trumps. It doesn't really matter whether they are familiar with the concept yet, the game will make their involvement grow.","","### Mock-ups","[Mock-up of the mobile version of the game](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project/blob/master/images/Mock-ups/Mobile%20mock-up%20anonymus%20rider.JPG?raw=true).","[Mock-up of the desktop version of the game](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project/blob/master/images/Mock-ups/Desktop%20mock-up%20name%20and%20flag.jpg?raw=true)","","As you can see there are some small diferences between the mock-up and actual game. On desktop I moved the aside to the right of the game, because it makes more sence to keep the actual game on the prominent left side. Besides that small images are made to the lay-out.","","### User stories","As a player, I want:","1.\tThe ability to easily find and understand the controls for the game, so I can operate them easily.","2.\tTo have the feeling either I got conformation of my knowledge or have really learned something.","3.\tTo get a feeling of real interaction while playing the game.","4.\tTo enjoy myself.","5.\tTo get recognition for my score, so I feel good or get stimulated to try again.","6.\tTo get no errors while playing the game, so I can really get into the game.","","## Features","","### Existing features","**Who is this cyclist?** – The question this game is all about. What is the name of the rider shown in the image?","","**How to play?**  – Allows the user to find out more **About the game** and ","how to play it. On mobile by clicking a button that will guide the user to the rules of the game. On desktop the information is shown on the right of the screen.","","**Let's play** – Allows the user to start playing the game by clicking on the button that says 'Let's Play'. The first of 10 images will be shown.","","**Image** –  Every image shows a professional (ex-)cyclist with a recognisable haircut and the shirt in which he was most successful. The lower part of the card contains the score of the rider on six important qualities on a scale from 0-100. Next to his head are the big prices he won. The pink jersey for the Giro, the yellow one for the Tour, the red one for La Vuelta and the Roman pillar for the Monuments. The name of the cyclist and his nationality normally stand in the gray area at the top of the card, but are erased for the purpose of the game.","","**Textfield** – Allows the user to give an answer by typing in the name of the rider.","","**Submit** – Allows the user to send in his answer and have It checked. If the answer is correct, the image flips and the name and nationality of the rider are shown in the image. Beneath the image the message 'Yes, that's him!' is shown. If the answer is wrong, the image is blurred and the user gets the option to **Give Up** or to **Try Again**. After two wrong answers the message 'Sorry, no score' shows and no points are added to the **Score**.","","**Give me a hint** – Allows the user to get a little help in finding the right answer by clicking the button that says 'Give me a Hint'. The image flips and the flag of the nation the rider comes from appears. ","","**Try again** – Allows the user to try again after giving a first wrong answer. The image *unblurs*.  ","","**Give up** – Allows the user to give up by clicking the button that says 'Give Up'. The image flips and the right answer is shown, together with the message: 'Sorry, no score'.","","**Next challenge** – Allows the user to go to the next image by clicking on the button that says  Next Challenge'. After 10 rounds the button leads the user to his final score.","","**Round** – Allows the user to see in which of the 10 rounds he is at any moment during the game by looking in the input-field beneath 'ROUND'.","","**Score** – Allows the user to see his score at any moment during the game by looking in the input-field field beneath 'SCORE'. On every round: if the first answer is right, three points will be added. A hint and a wrong answer cost one of those three points. After two wrong answers no points will be added.","","**Your Score** – Allows the user to see his final score by looking in the input-field next to 'Your Score' on the endpage.'","","**Score comment** – Allows the user to see a comment on his score. This varies from 'Maybe you should try again?' to 'You're a true champion'.","","**Play again** – Allows the user to play the game again by clicking on the button that says 'Play Again.","","### Features left to implement","1.\tDifficulty level ","It would be nice to make the game for two or three levels of difficulty. This could be done by entering less well-known riders in the game. Allowing only one wrong answer, instead of two is also a possibility. As is a timelimit.","","2.\tTimelimit","By adding a timelimit, the game might get a bit more exciting. This could be done by giving more points for a fast answer, or only by giving the player just a certain amount of time to answer. ","","3.\tDifferent subjects","In the current game the images are of the biggest icons of pro cyclings history. In this line there could also be a version with current riders, male and female. Or of former Tour de France or Tour of Flanders winners. The possibilities are endless.","As said the images could be of any subject. From learning a language, to famous movi-posters, to ex-presidents, to car-models. Anything is possible.","","4.\tShare and invite buttons"," By making it possible for players to share their score with their friends through social media and invite them to play the game, the involvement and the fun will grow even more.","","5.\tBuild an app","To make the mobile experience more impressive an app should be built for the game.","","## Technologies used","•\tHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.","","•\tIDE: [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?hp=tile&so-exp=below) but was forced to switch to [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since the Cloud9 service of Amazon is impossible to work with.","","•\t[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the grid system of the page.","","•\t[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts.","","•\t[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons in the footer of the website.","","•\t[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) to simplify the JavaScript.","","•\tPaint to edit the images used.","","•\tGoogle Chrome developer tools.","","•\tBash / Ubuntu to commit my project and to push it to Github.","","•\t[Github](https://github.com/) for version control and for users to view the deployed version of the website.","","## Testing","","### Responsive testing","The responsiveness of the page was tested at all times during the development of the game.

The game basically consists of a image and a textfield. When typing in the right answer in the textfield, the image flips and the right answer is shown. There is also a possibility to ask for a hint.","","This specific version of the game uses images from Pro Cycling Trumps (PCT). PCT is a British concept which basically contains of simple but fitting drawings of pro cyclists on playing cards. Naturally other images can be used as well. ","The design of the game is also very suited for learning a language; the player than has to type in the name of the object the image shows in the language he or she is learning.","","- [View the game here](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project)","- [View the Github Repository here](https://peterlenting.github.io/second-milestone-project/index.html)","","## Contents table","1.

[Disclaimer](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project#disclaimer)","","## UX","","### What is it?","A clean, fast and well-arranged application, which gives the visitor a fun experience, an opportunity to upgrade their knowledge and to be interactive with, in this case, PCT. ","A single page application with a mobile first design. The game should be really simple and easy to play, but also fun and interactive.","","### Who is the target audience? ","Anybody who likes to test their knowledge on any subject in a fun way is a member of the target audience.","In this specific case the target audience is the international pro cycling fan. People who know a little more about the pro peloton and like to test their knowledge. Maybe they are costumers of Pro Cycling Trumps. It doesn't really matter whether they are familiar with the concept yet, the game will make their involvement grow.","","### Mock-ups","[Mock-up of the mobile version of the game](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project/blob/master/images/Mock-ups/Mobile%20mock-up%20anonymus%20rider.JPG?raw=true).","[Mock-up of the desktop version of the game](https://github.com/PeterLenting/second-milestone-project/blob/master/images/Mock-ups/Desktop%20mock-up%20name%20and%20flag.jpg?raw=true)","","As you can see there are some small diferences between the mock-up and actual game. On desktop I moved the aside to the right of the game, because it makes more sence to keep the actual game on the prominent left side. Besides that small changes are made to the lay-out. The yellow colour is chosen because yellow is the most iconic colour in cycling. It is the colour of the leadersjersey in the Tour de France.","","### User stories","As a player, I want:","1.\tThe ability to easily find and understand the controls of the game, so I can operate them easily.","2.\tTo have the feeling I either got conformation of my great knowledge or have really learned something.","3.\tTo get a feeling of real interaction while playing the game.","4.\tTo enjoy myself.","5.\tTo get recognition for my score, so I feel good or get stimulated to try again.","6.\tTo get no errors while playing the game, so I can really get into it.","","## Features","","### Existing features","**Who is this cyclist?** – The question this game is all about. What is the name of the cyclist shown in the image?","","**How to play?**  – Allows the user to find out more **About the game** and how to play it. On mobile by clicking a button that will guide the user to the rules of the game. On desktop the information is shown on the right of the screen.","","**Let's play** – Allows the user to start playing the game by clicking on the button that says 'Let's Play'. The first of 10 images will be shown.","","**Image** –  Every image shows a professional (ex-)cyclist with a recognisable haircut and the shirt in which he was most successful. The lower part of the card contains the score of the cyclist on six important qualities on a scale from 0-100. Next to his head are the big prices he won. The pink jersey for the Giro, the yellow one for the Tour, the red one for La Vuelta and the Roman pillar for the Monuments. The name of the cyclist and his nationality normally stand in the gray area at the top of the card, but are erased for the purpose of the game.","","**Textfield** – Allows the user to give an answer by typing in the name of the cyclist.","","**Submit** – Allows the user to send in his answer and have it checked. If the answer is correct, the image flips and the name and nationality of the cyclist are shown in the image. Beneath the image the message 'Yes, that's him!' is shown. If the answer is wrong, the image is blurred and the user gets the option to **Give Up** or to **Try Again**. After two wrong answers the message 'Sorry, no score' shows and no points are added to the **Score**.","","**Give me a hint** – Allows the user to get a little help in finding the right answer by clicking the button that says 'Give me a Hint'. The image flips and the flag of the nation the cyclist comes from appears. ","","**Try again** – Allows the user to try again after giving a first wrong answer. The image *unblurs*.  ","","**Give up** – Allows the user to give up by clicking the button that says 'Give Up'. The image flips and the right answer is shown, together with the message: 'Sorry, no score'.","","**Next challenge** – Allows the user to go to the next image by clicking on the button that says 'Next Challenge'. After 10 rounds the button leads the user to his final score.","","**Round** – Allows the user to see in which of the 10 rounds he is at any moment during the game by looking in the input-field beneath 'ROUND'.","","**Score** – Allows the user to see his score at any moment during the game by looking in the input-field field beneath 'SCORE'. On every round: if the first answer is right, three points will be added. A hint and a wrong answer cost one of those three points. After two wrong answers no points will be added.","","**Your Score** – Allows the user to see his final score by looking in the input-field next to 'Your Score' on the endpage.'","","**Score comment** – Allows the user to see a comment on his score. This varies from 'Maybe you should try again?' to 'You're a true champion'.","","**Play again** – Allows the user to play the game again by clicking on the button that says 'Play Again.","","### Features left to implement","1.\tDifficulty level ","It would be nice to make the game for two or three levels of difficulty. This could be done by entering less well-known cyclists in the game. Allowing only one wrong answer, instead of two is also a possibility. As is a timelimit.","","2.\tTimelimit","By adding a timelimit, the game might get a bit more exciting. This could be done by giving more points for a fast answer, or only by giving the player just a certain amount of time to answer. ","","3.\tDifferent subjects","In the current game the images are of the biggest icons of pro cyclings history. In this line there could also be a version with current cyclists, male and female. Or of former Tour de France or Tour of Flanders winners. The possibilities are endless.","As said the images could be of any subject. From learning a language, to famous movi-posters, to ex-presidents, to car-models. Anything is possible.","","4.\tShare and invite buttons"," By making it possible for players to share their score with their friends through social media and invite them to play the game, the involvement and the fun will grow even more.","","5.\tBuild an app","To make the mobile experience more impressive an app should be built for the game.","","## Technologies used","•\tHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.","","•\tIDE: [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?hp=tile&so-exp=below) but was forced to switch to [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since the Cloud9 service of Amazon is impossible to work with.","","•\t[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the grid system of the page.","","•\t[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts.","","•\t[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons in the footer of the website.","","•\t[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) to simplify the JavaScript.","","•\tPaint to edit the images used.","","•\tGoogle Chrome developer tools.","","•\tBash / Ubuntu to commit my project and to push it to Github.","","•\t[Github](https://github.com/) for version control and for users to view the deployed version of the website.","","## Testing","","### Responsive testing","The responsiveness of the page was tested at all times during the development of the game. Locally as well as on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools. ","","### Manual testing","","I played the game myself and had other people playing it as well during the development.
